# CNN-from-scratch
This is the first attempt of the CNN from scratch series. From several blog post, finally this is the first version, though have to make several changes.
As the neural net is not much genaralised, and is capable for only 2D images and also can only have one convolution.

### WORKING PARTS:
1. Softmax layer is fully working
2. Simple Convolution, pooling are working totally

### TODO:
1. Make it for general RGB images
2. Have to add padding
3. Make the convoliution more generalised such that, it will act as a layer 
4. Make the back propagation more generalised.
5. Convolution kernels must be generalised (now its only having 3x3 and pooling has 2x2 kernels) 
6. Make a jupyter notebook showing the outputs for some images using this model

### FURURE TASKS
1. Optimise the code and add as much vectorization we can
2. Add some optimisation techniques
3. Make a library out of it
4. Make a good documentation

### SPECIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1. Victor Zhou
2. Piotr Skalski
3. Andrew Ng

Also thanks to several other medium blogs to make it possible
